Brief Project Description: Plants vs zombies (pvz), where the player plays on the side of the zombies. It would have similar features to the original pvz game, with a recharge time for zombies and ability to choose which row to put the zombies in. If we have time, we could include power ups for the zombies.

5/24
Xiaoshen: Drew the initial design for game and worked on proposal. Added variables, methods, and subclasses for zombies and plants! (more details in doc above)
Jennifer: Wrote pixelate method to make pixelated icons for plants/zombies
